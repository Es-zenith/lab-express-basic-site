    <h3> Career</h3>

        In 2015, the siblings released two songs on SoundCloud, titled "sHE'S brOKen" and "Fingers Crossed". "We had no intention for them," said Eilish later, saying that the songs were released "for fun and for our friends to listen to".

        In October 2015, Finneas informed Eilish of a song he had been playing with his band titled "ocean eyes". Eilish recorded the song and sent it to her dance teacher, who hoped to choreograph a dance to it. "Ocean Eyes", the debut single under the name Billie Eilish, was released on SoundCloud in 2016 and was a viral hit, much to the surprise of Eilish and Finneas. A music video was released on March 24th, 2016, and a video of Eilish performing a dance to the song was released on November 22nd, 2016. That year, she also released "Six Feet Under", which was not nearly as successful as "Ocean Eyes", but got attention from listeners and was a success among the small fanbase that Eilish had earned. "Ocean Eyes" was released worldwide through Darkroom and on November 18th, 2016 to positive critical reviews. "Ocean Eyes" is "a ballad about longing for reconciliation with an ex. I can imagine it becoming a major hit," said Chris DeVille of Stereogum. On January 13th, 2017, Eilish released an EP with four remixes of "Ocean Eyes" by the likes of Blackbear and Astronomyy. The Astronomyy remix took off immediately, becoming even more popular than the original track on Spotify.
